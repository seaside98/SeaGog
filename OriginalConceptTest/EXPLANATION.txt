This is the test game I made for my original project idea. 
Very cheesy and basic but you get the idea.


Controls:
W, A, S, D keys = player movement
Mouse movement = primary cursor movement
Arrow keys = secondary cursor movement (originally there was only one cursor but something went screwy with the new Blender update so I had to add a second one for aiming)
Spacebar = jump


Object: Just left and right click different things, you will get the idea eventually.
